/**
 * Find Sets Of Numbers That Add Up To 16
 * [2, 4, 6, 10] there are to subsets [6, 10] and [2, 4, 10] with the sum 16
 * So expected return is 2 - number of subsets.

 *
 * Given an int array with no duplicate numbers,
 * write a function to return number of ways to calculate a target number.
 * example: given {2,4,6,8} Target = 12
 * 2 + 4 + 6 = 12,
 * 4 + 8 = 12,
 * 6 + 8 - 2 = 12,
 * 2 - 4 + 6 + 8 = 12,
 * return 4
